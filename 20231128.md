### What is "Information"?

Information, n. Knowledge communicated or received 
concerning a particular fact or circumstance.

### Quantifying Information (Claude Shannon,1948)

Suppose you're faced with N equally probable choices, and I give you
a fact that narrows it down to M choices. Then I've given you $log_2(N/M)$ bits of information.

Examples:
- information in one coin flip: $log_2(2/1)$ = 1 bit
- roll of 2 dice: $log_2(36/1)$ = 5.2 bits
- outcome of a Red Sox game: 1 bit

### Encoding

- Encoding describes the process of
    assigning representations to information
- Choosing an appropriate and efficient encoding is a 
  real engineering challenge
- Impacts design at many levels
  - Mechanism (devices, # of components used)
  - Efficiency (bits used)
  - Reliability (noise)
  - Security (encryption)

### Fixed-length encodings

If all choices are equally likely (or we have no reason to expect otherwise), then a fixed-length code is often used. Such a code will use at least enough bits to represent the information content.

### Encoding numbers
It is straightforward to encode positive integers as a sequence of bits.Each bit is assigned a weight. Ordered from right to left, these weights areincreasing powers of 2. The value of an n-bit number encoded in this fashion is given by the following formula
$ v = \sum ^ {n-1} _ {i=0} 2 ^ {i} b_{i}$

### Hamming Distance
### Error Detection
### Error Correction

## Summary

• Information resolves uncertainty
• Choices equally probable:
• N choices down to M log2 (N/M) bits of information
• use fixed-length encodings
• encoding numbers: 2’s complement signed integers
• Choices not equally probable:
• choicei with probability pi log2(1/pi ) bits of information
• average number of bits = pi log2 (1/pi )
• use variable-length encodings
• To detect D-bit errors: Hamming distance > D
• To correct D-bit errors: Hamming distance > 2D Next time
• encoding information electrically
• the digital abstraction
• combinational devices


## Mathematics for Computer Science
Albert announces to his class that he plans to surprise them with a quiz sometime
next week.
His students first wonder if the quiz could be on Friday of next week. They
reason that it can’t: if Albert didn’t give the quiz before Friday, then by midnight
Thursday, they would know the quiz had to be on Friday, and so the quiz wouldn’t
be a surprise any more.
Next the students wonder whether Albert could give the surprise quiz Thursday.
They observe that if the quiz wasn’t given before Thursday, it would have to be
given on the Thursday, since they already know it can’t be given on Friday. But
having figured that out, it wouldn’t be a surprise if the quiz was on Thursday either.
Similarly, the students reason that the quiz can’t be on Wednesday, Tuesday, or
Monday. Namely, it’s impossible for Albert to give a surprise quiz next week. All
the students now relax, having concluded that Albert must have been bluffing. And
since no one expects the quiz, that’s why, when Albert gives it on Tuesday next
week, it really is a surprise!
What, if anything, do you think is wrong with the students’ reasoning
