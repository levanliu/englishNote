### How the linux kernel handles a TCP connection.

The Linux kernel handles TCP connections by implementing the TCP/IP protocol stack, which includes various layers such as the network interface, IP, and TCP layers. Here's a high-level overview of how the Linux kernel deals with a TCP connection:

1. Socket Creation: The application creates a socket using system calls like `socket()` or `accept()`. The socket represents an endpoint for communication.

2. Binding: The application binds the socket to an IP address and port using the `bind()` system call. This step is usually optional for client-side sockets.

3. Listening (Server-side): For server-side sockets, the application listens for incoming connections using the `listen()` system call.

4. Connection Establishment: For initiating a connection (client-side), the application uses the `connect()` system call, which triggers a series of actions in the kernel.

   a. IP Address Resolution: The kernel resolves the IP address of the destination using DNS or routing table lookup.

   b. Three-Way Handshake: The TCP layer starts a three-way handshake by sending a SYN packet to the destination. It waits for an SYN+ACK response from the server, and then sends an ACK to complete the handshake.

5. Data Transmission: Once the connection is established, data transmission occurs through the following steps:

   a. Data Segmentation: The application's data is divided into smaller segments at the TCP layer to fit the network's Maximum Segment Size (MSS) limit.

   b. Reliable Delivery: The kernel ensures reliable delivery of the data by handling packet retransmissions, acknowledgments, congestion control, and flow control, as defined by the TCP protocol.

   c. Buffer Management: The kernel manages send and receive buffers to temporarily hold data during transmission.

6. Connection Termination: To terminate the TCP connection, either side can initiate the closure.

   a. Active Close: The application initiates the termination by calling `close()` system call, which sends a FIN packet to the other end.

   b. Passive Close: The other end acknowledges the FIN, and then initiates its termination by sending its own FIN packet.

   c. Two-Way Shutdown: Both sides exchange FIN packets, and after the exchange is complete, the connection is closed.
