### What are the main difference between "final" keyword in Java and the "const" and "constexpr" keywords in C++?
The "final" keyword in Java and the "const" or "constexpr" keywords in C++ serve similar purposes, but with some important differences.

In Java:
- The "final" keyword can be applied to variables, methods, and classes.
- When applied to a variable, it indicates that the variable's value cannot be changed once it has been initialized.
- When applied to a method, it indicates that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
- When applied to a class, it indicates that the class cannot be extended (i.e., no subclassing is allowed).

In C++:
- The "const" keyword is used to declare that a variable is constant and cannot be modified after initialization.
- The "constexpr" keyword is used to declare that a variable or function must be evaluated at compile time (in the case of a variable) or that a function can be evaluated at compile time (in the case of a function).
- Both "const" and "constexpr" can be applied to variables, and "const" can also be used to declare const-correctness in member functions.

One of the key differences is that in C++, "const" and "constexpr" are primarily used for variables, whereas in Java, "final" is used for a wider range of entities, including variables, methods, and classes.

Additionally, in C++, "constexpr" allows for compile-time evaluation of expressions and functions, providing a mechanism for ensuring certain computations are performed at compile time rather than run time, which can lead to potential performance benefits.

Overall, while the concepts of immutability and compile-time evaluation are similar between the two languages, the specific use cases and syntax for "final" in Java and "const" and "constexpr" in C++ have their own distinct differences.
