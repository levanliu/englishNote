CAN  ( area netwrok)
1. Identify the necessary hardware components:
   - CAN Transceiver: This component handles the electrical signaling and voltage levels between the microcontroller and the CAN bus.   - Microcontroller with CAN Controller: Choose a microcontroller that has a built-in CAN controller or one that supports external CAN controller modules.

2. Set up the hardware connections:
   - Connect the CAN transceiver's CAN_H and CAN_L lines to the corresponding pins on the microcontroller.
   - Ensure proper power supply and ground connections to both the microcontroller and the CAN transceiver.
   - It is essential to have appropriate termination resistors at both ends of the bus to reduce signal reflections.

3. Configure the CAN controller:
   - Use the microcontroller's datasheet and reference manual to learn how to configure the CAN controller registers.
   - Set up the appropriate baud rate, identification (ID) filters, interrupt settings, message buffers, and error handling mechanisms based on your requirements.
   - Enable the CAN controller and configure it as the "master" or "node" on the CAN bus.

4. Implement the software:
   - Depending on your microcontroller and development environment, you may need to use specific CAN libraries or APIs provided by the manufacturer.
   - Initialize the CAN controller by configuring the settings you established in the previous step.
   - Send data: Prepare the necessary data packets, including the ID and payload, and initiate the transmission using appropriate functions or methods.
   - Receive data: Set up interrupt handlers or polling mechanisms to read incoming data from the CAN bus. Decode the received packets and extract the required information.
   - Implement error handling: Monitor the CAN controller's error registers to detect and handle any transmission or reception errors that may occur on the bus.

5. Test and validate:
   - Connect your device to the CAN bus network with other nodes/devices.
   - Verify that your device can send and receive data correctly, ensuring compatibility with other CAN devices on the network.
   - Perform thorough testing to confirm the stability and reliability of the communication.

Note: It is always recommended to refer to the specific documentation and resources provided by the microcontroller manufacturer or any additional CAN controller modules you may be using.
## GEF

### what is GEF?

```
Graphical Editing Framework
```

### What is architecture of GEF?

```
MVC
```

### what is main components of GEF?

```
Model: (EMF)
View: (Graphical Viewer)
Controller: (EditPart)
```

### How does GEF work?

1. Create a model: Define the data structure that represents the elements to be edited in the graphical editor. In SmarTEST8, it's EMF.
2. Create an EditPart: EditPart is a interface, it will handle the interaction between the model and view. Implement the org.eclipse.gef.EditPart interface to create a controller for the model element.
3. Create an EditPartFactory: Implement the org.eclipse.gef.EditPartFactory interface to create EditParts for different model elements. The EditPartFactory is responsible for creating the appropriate EditPart for each model element.
4. Create a GraphicalViewer: create a org.eclipse.gef.GraphicalViewer to display the graphcial representation of the model. This viewer will be reponsible for managing the EditParts and their visual representation.
5. Create a RootEditPart: Create a org.eclipse.gef.RootEditPart that acts as the root controller for the graphical editor. This Editpart will manage the creation and deletion of child EditParts.
6. Connect the EditParts: Use the org.eclipse.gef.EditPart hierarchy to connect the EditParts together. Each EditPart should have a reference to its parent EditPart and its child EditParts.
7. Implement EditPart behavior: Implement the necessary methods in the EidtPart to handle user interactions, such as selection, dragging, and resizing. These methods will update the model and the view accordingly.
8. Register the EditPart: Register the EditPart and the EditPartFactory with the GraphicalViewer. This will allow the viewer to create and manage the EditParts.

### Instrument View

| Responsibility                                               | Location | Module Documentation |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------- |
| awg, clock, dcVI, digInOut, digitizer, loopback, rfMeas, rfStim, rfVna, utility |          | isv.ui.overview.md   |


In general Instrument view is implemented based on Eclipse view.
Instrument view is splitted into 4 modules for better modularity and maintainability: InstrumentUI, InstrumentCore, DiagramUI and DiagramCore. InstrumentUI is responsible for the UI part of Instrument view, InstrumentCore is responsible for the core part of Instrument view, DiagramUI is responsible for diagram rendering, DiagramCore is responsible for diagram data model.


EditPart is a key component in Eclipse Plugin development that is used in the Graphical Editing Framew
ork (GEF). It acts as a controller between the model and the view in a graphical editor. EditPart is respons
ible for managing the creation, deletion, and updating of the visual representation of a model element.

The usage of EditPart in Eclipse Plugin development involves the following steps:

1. Create a model: Define the data structure that represents the elements to be edited in the graphical edit
   or. This model should implement the necessary interfaces, such as `org.eclipse.gef.EditPart`.

2. Create an EditPart: Implement the `org.eclipse.gef.EditPart` interface to create a controller for the mod
   el element. This EditPart will handle the interaction between the model and the view.

3. Create a EditPartFactory: Implement the `org.eclipse.gef.EditPartFactory` interface to create EditParts f
   or different model elements. The EditPartFactory is responsible for creating the appropriate EditPart for ea
   ch model element.

4. Create a GraphicalViewer: Create a `org.eclipse.gef.GraphicalViewer` to display the graphical representat
   ion of the model. This viewer will be responsible for managing the EditParts and their visual representation
   .

5. Create a RootEditPart: Create a `org.eclipse.gef.RootEditPart` that acts as the root controller for the g
   raphical editor. This EditPart will manage the creation and deletion of child EditParts.

6. Connect the EditParts: Use the `org.eclipse.gef.EditPart` hierarchy to connect the EditParts together. Ea
   ch EditPart should have a reference to its parent EditPart and its child EditParts.

7. Implement EditPart behavior: Implement the necessary methods in the EditPart to handle user interactions,
   such as selection, dragging, and resizing. These methods will update the model and the view accordingly.

8. Register the EditPart: Register the EditPart and the EditPartFactory with the GraphicalViewer. This will 
   allow the viewer to create and manage the EditParts.
