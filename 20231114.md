## Building a simple model

In this section, we build a simple but realistic model.
The purpose is to demonstrate the main step of the process.
Later in our redbook, we use the Graphical Editing Framework(GEF), to 
build a workflow application on top of this model. The workflow editor will
help us to create and visualize the content of the model.
For more information, the applicaiton requirements and design can be 
found in "Sample application requirements" on Page 188.

- The model
Before starting to describe the modeling process using Eclipse and EMF,
we need to understand the complete underlying UML model that we will build.
This is shown in Figure 1-4 and discussed in more detail in "The workflow 
model" on page 192.
