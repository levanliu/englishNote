### the heap timer usage.

```cpp

#include "heaptimer.h"

void HeapTimer::shiftup_(size_t i){
    assert(i >= 0 && i < heap_.size());

    size_t j = (i-1)/2;
    while(j >= 0){
        if(heap_[j] < heap[i]) { break; }

    }
}


void HeapTimer::SwapNode(size_t i, size_t j){
    assert(i >= 0 && i < heap_.size());
    assert(j >= 0 && j < heap_.size());

    std::swap(heap[i],heap[j]);
    ref_[heap[i].id] = i;
    ref_[heap[j].id] = j;
}

void HeapTimer::siftUp(size_t index,size_t n){
    assert(index >= 0 && index < heap_.size());
    size_t i = index;
    size_t j = (i-1)/2;
    while( j >= 0){
        if(heap[j] < heap[i]) {break;}
        SwapNode(i,j);
        i = j;
        j = (i-1)/2;
    }
}

void HeapTimer::siftDown(size_t index,size_t n){
    assert(index >= 0 && index < heap_.size());
    assert(n >=0 && n < heap_.size());
    int i = index;
    int j = i*2 +1;
    while(j < n){
        if( j + 1 < n && heap_[j+1] < heap_[j] ) j++;
        if( heap_[i] < heap_[j]) break;
        SwapNode_(i,j);
        i = j;
        j = i*2 + 1;
    }
}
```

```cpp

int HeapTimer::GetNextTick(){
    tick();
    size_t res = -1;
    if(!heap_.empry()){
        /**
         * it use std::chrono::duration_cast to convert it to a dutation type specified by the MS variable
         * which likely represents milliseconds) Then, calling the count() function on this duration gives you the
         * number of milliseconds in that duration
         */
        res = std::chrono::duration_cast<MS>(heap.front().expires - Clock::now()).count();
        if(res < 0) { res = 0;}
    }
    return res;
}
```
### Job in Eclipse
mechanism similar to a thread pool. 
A Job in Eclipse is responsible for executing a task or series of tasks asynchronously in the background. 
It manages the execution of the task(s) and provides methods to monitor the job's progress, control its scheduling, and retrieve the result (if any).

Behind the scenes, Jobs in Eclipse are executed using threads from a thread pool managed by the Eclipse Platform. When you schedule a job, the Platform assigns a thread from the pool to execute the job's run() method. This allows the job to run concurrently with other jobs and user interface operations without blocking the main user interface thread.

Jobs provide several advantages over manually managing threads:

Jobs are managed by the Eclipse Platform, so you don't have to worry about low-level thread creation and management.
Jobs can be scheduled to run at a specific time, after a delay, or when specific conditions are met.
Jobs can be executed only when the system is idle, which helps avoid unnecessary resource consumption.
Jobs provide built-in support for progress monitoring, cancellation, and error handling.
Jobs can be categorized and prioritized, allowing for better control and organization of tasks.
Jobs can be deferred, rescheduled, or canceled if needed.
In summary, while a Job in Eclipse has some similarities to a thread pool mechanism, it provides additional functionality and abstraction to make background processing and threading easier and more efficient in the Eclipse Platform.
